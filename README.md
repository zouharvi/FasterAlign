# SlowAlign

Word aligner written in Rust with a few extra features, most notably (1) heuristic parameter estimation in a supervised fashion using gridsearch, (2) combination of multiple soft alignments and (3) data-less alignment based on diagonal alignment, levenstein distance and bluring. See [REPORT.md Feb 2021](meta/REPORT.md) for further description.
